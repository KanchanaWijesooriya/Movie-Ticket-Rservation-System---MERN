Welcome to the Movie Tickets Reservation System! This project is designed to simplify the management of movie ticket reservations by leveraging data structures and algorithms to efficiently process user inputs, specifically utilizing 2D arrays. A standout feature of this system is that users are not required to create an account or log in, providing a seamless experience. Developed using the MERN stack, the system allows users to select seats and reserve tickets according to their preferences. Customers can visualize their seat choices and make adjustments through the seat reservation tab. Additionally, users can perform various tasks, such as changing their seat numbers, viewing upcoming movies, selecting dates and times, and returning their reservations.

The system also includes an admin control panel for managing movie schedules and other administrative tasks. While not all features are fully functional, the project provides a clear understanding of its intended capabilities. The development process followed agile methodology, and the project includes both frontend and backend APIs.
